# Multi-Layer-Perceptron
<p>
A multilayer perceptron is a type of artificial neural network that consists of two or more layers of neurons. These neurons are connected to each other to form a network. It's important to note that the term "perceptron" in the name is merely a historical legacy, as a multilayer perceptron is not composed of perceptrons but rather sigmoid neurons or neurons with another type of activation function. In other words, it uses a logistic function.
